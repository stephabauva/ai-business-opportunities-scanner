At Welcome to the Jungle, we help people find their people. We offer a suite of tools, content and experiences that make recruitment more transparent, more human and less lonely.

We help companies build their recruitment strategy by telling their story through their employer brand, to attract, engage and retain the talent that fits their culture.
We help candidates discover their future team through immersive job offers, and we support them at every stage of their search with a candidate space made for them.
Because jobs are important. But people are everything.
What they are looking for
From the very beginning of our journey, we wanted to create a multidisciplinary team with diverse profiles.

Our array of roles creates a distinctive work environment where collaboration thrives among sales professionals, communicators, journalists, and developers, to name a few.

The entire team is driven by a shared mission: to shape the future of work at scale. This challenge is not only ambitious and exciting but also, full of learning opportunities.

We're not in pursuit of a specific profile; rather, we seek individuals eager to contribute to the ongoing expansion of Welcome to the Jungle, make a genuine daily impact, and swiftly assume significant responsibilities.
